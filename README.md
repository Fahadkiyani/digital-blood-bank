# Digital-Blood-Bank


**Version 1.0.0**
## Vision
 DBB(digital blood bank) is a web application, which will be used to connect two clients to eachother e.g. if one wants to donate the blood and other needs the blood.

 DBB(digital blood bank) is an idea of keeping record of blood donners. The donner can use this app to store his details on his user account e.g. his name, contact, place, blood type, when he last gave the blood and is he willing to give blood again.
 
 On the other hand, a person, who needs the blood will come to our website and see the details which blood type he needs and he can contact the person.

## How to use this app
 This app would be very simple to use. Even a illitrate person will be able to use this app. We will make its UI/UX user friendly a person would only have to enter the blood type in input and the app will tell him which blood can be used for tranfusion for him. 

 ## Will it be secured
Yes!
