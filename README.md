**Version 1.0.0**
## vision
 DBB(digital blood bank) is a web application, which will be used to connect two clients to each e.g. if one wants to donate the blood and other needs the blood.

 DBB(digital blood bank) is an idea of keeping record of blood donners. The donner can use this app to store his details on his user account e.g. his name, contact, place, blood type, when he last gave the blood and is he willing to give blood again.
 
 On the other hand, a person, who needs the blood he will come to our website and see the details which blood type he needs and he can contact the person.

 ## will it be secured
Yes! the person who needs the blood would only be able to send ping to donner and in result the donner will make contact on the platform.
